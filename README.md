# note-learner

An iOS app built using Xcode that teaches how to read music in the treble and bass clefs. The app includes 3 self-created lessons (Staff, Treble Clef, Bass Clef) and practice identifying notes from the treble, bass, or both staves. 

The source code can be found in the music1 folder.

The screenshots below demonstrate the user interface and functionality of the app.

# Note Learner

An iOS app built using Xcode that teaches how to read music in the treble and bass staves. The app includes 3 self-created lessons (Staff, Treble Clef, Bass Clef) and practice identifying notes in both staves. 

The source code can be found in the `music1` folder.

The screenshots below demonstrate the user interface and functionality of the app.
